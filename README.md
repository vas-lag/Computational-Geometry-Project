# Computational-Geometry-Project
This is an Academic Project from the course "Computational Geometry and Applications on 3D Modelling".

Given an input Mesh the program covers the following tasks:
1. Calculation and visualization of differential coordinates
2. Calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix
3. Reconstruction of the original Mesh given its differential coordinates by only using a percentage of the computed eigenvectors
4. Visualization of the difference between the original Mesh and the reconstructed one
5. Creation of a metric that describes the shape of the Mesh on the frequency domain
6. Shape indexing, given an input Mesh rank every other Mesh in order of similarity
